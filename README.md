# MyGameEngine
This is just me experimenting with Java by attempting to create a very basic game engine. I don't expect anyone to even see this, but if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.

This is mostly updated by me making a game using this engine. Whenever I come across an issue that I feel should really be in the engine, I add it in.
