# MyGameEngine
This is just me experimenting with Java by attempting to create a very basic 2d game engine. I don't expect anyone to even see this, but if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me.

This is mostly updated by me making a game using this engine. Whenever I come across an issue that I feel should really be in the engine, I add it in.

I do my best to keep the documentation up to date, but sometimes get behind.

I also do my best to keep a functional wiki here on github, but that is often even farther behind than the docs. It does however work, and can give at least a basic understanding of how to use this game engine.
